    <h4>About Mind Your Own Business</h4>

    <p>Welcome to Mind Your Own Business, 
        the online hub designed to empower 
        sole traders and small businesses by making 
        promotion simple, effective, and hassle-free.
    </p>

    <h5>Helping Small Businesses Get Noticed</h5>
    <p>When I was self-employed, running DL Cleaners, I quickly realized that one of the hardest parts of growing a business wasn’t the work itself—it was getting my name out there. Finding customers, promoting deals, and building a local presence felt like an uphill battle. That’s why I created Mind Your Own Business—to give small business owners like cleaners, nail technicians, personal trainers, landscapers, childminders, and tradespeople a platform where they can easily showcase their services and attract customers without relying on expensive advertising.
