## 💻 Code Attribution  

This project includes code that was developed with the assistance of AI and external resources:  

- **`logged_in_user()` Decorator** – A function to restrict access to routes that require authentication. AI was used to help refine the logic and improve efficiency.  
- **`getImages()` Function** – A function to handle image uploads by encoding them in Base64. Initially, I attempted to use standard Python imports for image handling but encountered issues. With AI assistance, I found a working approach using Flask’s `request.files` and Base64 encoding.  
- **Google Maps API Integration** – Implemented Google Maps to display business locations on profile pages. I used Google Docs to plan and document the implementation process and received some AI assistance to troubleshoot and refine the integration.  
- **Image Implementation** – AI also helped guide the integration of image processing into my code when traditional methods didn’t work.  

All other code was written by me, unless otherwise stated.
