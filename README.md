## 🧠 Design Decisions  

### 🪟 Introductory Pop-Up Window

To enhance user engagement and clearly communicate the platform's purpose, I implemented a **pop-up window that appears when users first visit the site**. This window serves as a brief introduction and welcome message, helping first-time visitors understand the site's core value and how to get started.  

The goal is to ensure users don’t feel lost or confused upon arrival, especially since the platform offers unique features for both business owners and customers.  

🔹 **Benefits of the Pop-Up Window**:
- Improves first-time user understanding and retention  
- Clearly highlights the platform's value proposition  
- Encourages users to register or explore promotions right away

## 💻 Code Attribution  

This project includes code that was developed with the assistance of AI and external resources:  

- **`logged_in_user()` Decorator** – A function to restrict access to routes that require authentication. AI was used to help refine the logic and improve efficiency.  
- **`getImages()` Function** – A function to handle image uploads by encoding them in Base64. Initially, I attempted to use standard Python imports for image handling but encountered issues. With AI assistance, I found a working approach using Flask’s `request.files` and Base64 encoding.  
- **Google Maps API Integration** – Implemented Google Maps to display business locations on profile pages. I used Google Docs to plan and document the implementation process and received some AI assistance to troubleshoot and refine the integration.  
- **Image Implementation** – AI also helped guide the integration of image processing into my code when traditional methods didn’t work.  

All other code was written by me, unless otherwise stated.
