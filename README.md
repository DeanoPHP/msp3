## 🔧 Enhancements & Advanced Features (For Distinction)

As part of tutor and mentor feedback, I implemented the following improvements and advanced logic in my project to elevate its usability, security, and professionalism.

### 🧠 Complex Logic and Features

#### 1. 🔒 Custom Login Required Decorator

To ensure that only authenticated users can access certain routes, I created a custom decorator named `logged_in_user`. This helps centralize the access control logic and keeps routes clean and readable.

While learning Node.js, I came across the concept of decorators and realized they could be useful for protecting routes in Flask. I cannot take full credit for the function itself, as I researched how to implement a login-required decorator in Flask. However, I understood the purpose and use case, and applied it successfully to my project to centralize access control logic and keep my routes clean and readable.


```
def logged_in_user():
    def decorator(f):
        @wraps(f)
        def decorated_function(*args, **kwargs):
            if "user" not in session:
                flash("You need to be logged in to access this page.", "danger")
                return redirect(url_for("main.login"))
            return f(*args, **kwargs)
        return decorated_function
    return decorator
```

### 💡 Redirecting Users Back After Login

When a non-logged-in user tries to access a protected route, the application saves the original URL they attempted to visit in the session. After a successful login, they are redirected back to that original URL.

This improvement was made based on advice from my mentor, **Dick Vlaanderen**, during a review session.

**Saving the original URL (in a protected route):**

# Save the URL the user tried to visit
```
session["next"] = url_for("main.profile", username=username)
flash("Please log in to view profiles.", "warning")
return redirect(url_for("main.login"))
```

# After login, redirect back if there is a saved 'next' URL
```
if "next" in session:
    url = session.pop("next")
    flash("We noticed you tried accessing this page before logging in.", "success")
    return redirect(url)
```

### 🪟 Pop-Up Introduction & Navigation Options

Based on feedback from **Miguel Ortega Legorreta**, a staff member at **Bristol College**, I updated the landing page to improve clarity and usability for first-time visitors.

When a user first arrives at the site, they are presented with a **pop-up modal** that:

- Clearly explains what the website is about and how it works.
- Offers the user three options:
  - **Continue as Guest**
  - **Register**
  - **Log In**

This change helps users quickly understand the purpose of the site and choose how they want to interact with it. It also reduces confusion and enhances the onboarding experience for both new and returning visitors.

## 💻 Code Attribution  

This project includes code that was developed with the assistance of AI and external resources:  

- **`logged_in_user()` Decorator** – A function to restrict access to routes that require authentication. AI was used to help refine the logic and improve efficiency.  
- **`getImages()` Function** – A function to handle image uploads by encoding them in Base64. Initially, I attempted to use standard Python imports for image handling but encountered issues. With AI assistance, I found a working approach using Flask’s `request.files` and Base64 encoding.  
- **Google Maps API Integration** – Implemented Google Maps to display business locations on profile pages. I used Google Docs to plan and document the implementation process and received some AI assistance to troubleshoot and refine the integration.  
- **Image Implementation** – AI also helped guide the integration of image processing into my code when traditional methods didn’t work.  

All other code was written by me, unless otherwise stated.
